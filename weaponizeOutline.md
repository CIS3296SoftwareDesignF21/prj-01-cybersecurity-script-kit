# Weaponize Scripts Outline

This is an outline of the scripts that are to be written under this category.

Weaponize is the second step within the Cyber Security Kill Chain. The goal of this step is to use the information found from the first step â€“ Reconnaissance. The scripts written under this category are used to break through the network by exploiting vulnerabilities or some type of malicious code.
