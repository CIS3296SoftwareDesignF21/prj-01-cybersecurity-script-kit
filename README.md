For any cybersecurity professional, scripting is an important part of testing the defense of any network or computer system. Being able to have a collection of scripts that will automate any recurring process or having set of security tools is a must for any professional in the field. Not everyone is a coding wizard, being able to have a bunch of scripts at the drop of a hat is not only helpful but convenient. The idea for this project is to create a web site that will host a small library of scrips that would complete various tasks that any beginner or expert security professional would need in the field.

>### How to Run
Does not have a main function. This is executable code and will run once enabled. The execution or the code could be enable from the command line or start once downloaded on to the machine.

>### How to Install
This code is from scratch, the it hasn't been built yet to run.

>### Updates and changes
Instead of hosting on own site, make library directly on github. To test scripts, we will use GitHub CI. We will use the command line to download directly from GitHub. 

>### Vision
The developers will create a website that will host the library of cybersecurity tools. From there the end-user can download the tool or script and use it however they desire.

The Computer Science Student 
- Brandon, 20, is a third-year computer science student at Temple University. He is taking cybersecurity electives in hopes to develop a skillset good enough to land him a job in the field after graduation. He’s spent a few semesters learning the ins and outs of cybersecurity, and now he wants to put what he knows to practice so he can sharpen his skills and set himself apart during job interviews. He downloads the Cybersecurity Script Kit in order to complete his assignments faster while getting familiar with industry practices and necessary skills.
