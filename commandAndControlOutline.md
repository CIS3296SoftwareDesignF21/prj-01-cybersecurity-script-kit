# Command and Control Scripts Outline

- DoS Attack
    - Denial of service attack script
    - Use multiple IP multiple port script to send a large number of packets from multiple ports to attack

- Data Exfiltration
    - This data exfiltration tool uses regex for matching desired data patterns while scanning through specified file extensions

- Data Destruction
    - "File shredder" to delete files off of target
    - Use OS import to access operating system

Command and control is the sixth phase of the cyber kill chain. Command and control, also known as C2, is when the attacker has put in place their management and communication APT code onto to the target network. This software allows the attacker to fully manage the APT code in the environment and allows the attacker to move deeper into the network, exfiltrate data and conduct destruction or denial of service operations.
